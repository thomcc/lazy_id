//! [`lazy_id::Id`](Id) is a thread-safe 64-bit id that only initializes itself
//! to a specific value when you use it rather than when you create it.
//!
//! Why would this be helpful? If you need a unique per-instance `Id` for your
//! type, usually the approach is a global atomic that you increment each time
//! you allocate an id.  The only problem here is that now if you want to store
//! your type in a `static` of some sort, you need to use `OnceCell` or
//! `lazy_static`.
//!
//! This can be pretty annoying if your API is most useful as a `static`, and
//! you've been carefully designing to allow static initialization, especially
//! this now means the API you designed forces users to use these libraries
//! around your types.
//!
//! In my case, I was playing around with low level threading code already, and
//! the extra locking these imposed on all accesses felt like it completely
//! defeated the point of my fancy data structure, and would have shown up in
//! the public api.
//!
//! Anyway, unlike `lazy_static`/`OnceCell`/the hypothetical `std::lazy`, this
//! crate is entirely lock free, and only uses a few relaxed atomic operations
//! to initialize itself on first access (automatically), and the fast path of
//! reading an already-initialized `Id` is just a single relaxed `load`. This is
//! all to say, it's much more efficient than most of the alternatives would be
//! and more efficient than I had expected it to be.

/// A thread-safe lazily-initialized 64-bit ID.
///
/// This is useful if you have a structure which needs a unique ID, but don't
/// want to return it from a const fn, or for callers to be able to use it in
/// statics, without requiring that they lazily initialize the whole thing, e.g.
/// via `lazy_static` / `OnceCell` / etc.
///
/// The `Id` type initializes exactly once, and never returns a duplicate — the
/// only `Id`s which might have the same value as others are ones that come from
/// `Id`'s impl of `Clone` or [`Id::from_raw_integer`].
///
/// It supports most traits you'd want, including `Hash`, `Ord`, `Clone`,
/// `Deref<Target = u64>`, `PartialEq<u64>` (and `u64` has `PartialEq<Id>`),
/// `Debug`, `Display`, `Default` (same as [`Id::new`])...
///
/// `Id`'s initialization is entirely lock-free and uses only relaxed atomic
/// operations (nor is anything stronger needed). The fast path of [`Id::get`]
/// is just a `Relaxed` atomic load, which is the same cost as a non-atomic load
/// (on platforms that support 64-bit atomics efficiently, anyway).
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use lazy_id::Id;
/// struct Thing {
///     id: Id,
///     // other fields, ...
/// }
/// // Now this function can be const, which can let
/// // callers avoid needing to use `lazy_static`/`OnceCell`
/// // for constants of your type
/// const fn new_thing() -> Thing {
///     Thing { id: Id::lazy(), /* ... */ }
/// }
/// static C: Thing = new_thing();
/// let a = new_thing();
/// let b = new_thing();
/// assert!(a.id != b.id && a.id != C.id);
/// ```
///
/// ## FAQs
///
/// (Okay, nobody's asked me any of these, but it's a good format for misc.
/// documentation notes).
///
/// ### Are `Id`s unique?
///
/// Across different runs of your program? No. Id generation order is
/// deterministic and occurs in the same order every time.
///
/// Within a single run of your program? Yes, with two caveats:
///
/// 1. `Id` implements `Clone` by producing other `Id`s with the same numeric
///    value. This seems desirable, as it makes the `Id` behave as if it had
///    been produced eagerly, and more like a normal number.
///
/// 2. The function [`Id::from_raw_integer`] forces the creation of an `Id` with
///    a specific numeric value, which may or may not be a value which has been
///    returned already, and may or may not be one we'll return in the future.
///    This function should be used with care.
///
/// It's intentionally okay for unsafe code to assume `Id`s that it creates
/// through [`Id::new`]/[`Id::lazy`]/[`Id::LAZY_INITIALIZER`] will all have
/// distinct values.
///
/// ### You mentioned a counter, what about overflow?
///
/// The counter is 64 bits, so this will realistically never happen. If we
/// assume [`Id::new`] takes 1ns (optimistic), this would take 292 *years*.
/// Attempting to bring this down with ✨The Power Of Fearless Concurrency✨ would
/// probably not change this much (or would make it slower), due to that
/// increasing contention on the counter, but who knows.
///
/// If we do overflow, we `abort`. The `abort` (and not `panic`) is because it
/// is global state that is compromised, and so all threads need to be brought
/// down. Additionally, I want `lazy_id::Id` usable in cases where unsafe code
/// can rely on the values returned being unique (so long as they can ensure
/// that none of them came from `Id::from_raw_integer`).
///
/// ### What is `seq=` in the `"{:?}"` output of an `Id`?
///
/// Id debug formats like `"Id(0xhexhexhex; seq=32)"`. The `seq` value is a
/// monotonically increasing value that can help identify the order `Id`s were
/// initialized in, but mostly is a vastly more readable number than the real
/// number, which makes it good for debug output.
///
/// I may expose a way to convert between `id` values and `seq` values in the
/// future, let me know if you need it.
///
/// For a little more explanation: By default, ids are mixed somewhat, which
/// helps discourage people from using them as indexes into arrays or assuming
/// they're sequential, etc (they aren't — they're just monotonic). It also
/// might help them be better hash keys, but with a good hash algo it won't
/// matter.
